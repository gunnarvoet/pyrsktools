Supported RSK versions
############################

RSK files have different types and versions,
either of which may lead to differences in the underlying dataset structure.
pyRSKtools currently supports RSKs that are:

* "full" version 2.0.0 or later
* "EPdesktop" version 1.13.4 or later

.. Note::

    The version of an RSK file can be easily upgraded using RBR's `Ruskin software <RUSKIN_>`_.
    Upon installing Ruskin, simply:

    * Open your RSK file with Ruskin.

    * Go to the ``File info`` tab, which presents the current version and structure type.

    * Ruskin will detect whether there is a new version of the RSK file format is available. If so, there will be an ``Update`` button for you to upgrade your RSK file.

    * After clicking the ``Update`` button, a new RSK file of the latest version will be created in your specified directory.
